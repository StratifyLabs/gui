# SDK Folder

This is the folder where dependencies are stored. It has:

- `config`: configuration specific header files for dependencies.
- `dependencies`: the repositories of the dependencies.
- `StratifyLabs-SDK`: where libraries and binaries are installed.

The `depends.code-workspace` can be used to manage the changes using  [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
